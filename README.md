# Cyber Actor Atlas

React + Vite + Leaflet map for exploring the publicly reported origins of cyber actors, including malicious groups, cyber-enabled financial and crypto crime actors, and defensive white-hat organizations.

## What this project is

This is a curated, static atlas of cyber actors based on public attribution reporting and official organization information.

It is not:

- A live threat-intelligence feed
- A definitive list of every cyber actor
- A claim of legal guilt beyond what public reporting states
- A source of real-time incident statistics

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## What changed

The app now uses a bundled static dataset instead of live venue lookups. The map centers on the world, and the sidebar tracks whichever mapped groups are currently inside the viewport.

The current dataset blends cybercrime groups, cyber-enabled financial fraud actors, blockchain / crypto theft actors, hacktivist groups, hybrid actors that mix financial and political motives, and a set of prominent white-hat / defensive organizations. It includes first-tier globally notorious actors, a curated second-tier layer of widely tracked criminal and defensive groups, and a growing third-tier regional layer of actors and coordinators that matter within specific geographies.

The atlas can also include decentralized actors that do not have a defensible fixed geographic origin. Those entries remain searchable and exportable, but they are intentionally not pinned on the map. Current examples include `Anonymous`, `LulzSec`, and `AntiSec`.

Downloadable copies of the dataset are also published in Excel-friendly and machine-readable formats:

- [`public/data/cyber-actor-atlas.csv`](./public/data/cyber-actor-atlas.csv) for Excel, Google Sheets, and other spreadsheet tools
- [`public/data/cyber-actor-atlas.json`](./public/data/cyber-actor-atlas.json) for programmatic use

Each entry includes:

- Display name used in the app and exports
- Reported origin point
- Category
- First-seen year
- Tradecraft notes and source-backed alternate names where relevant
- Attribution note and source label

## Methodology

### How the dataset is built

The dataset source of truth is stored locally in [`src/data/groups.js`](./src/data/groups.js). There is no live API call and no automated sync. Each record is manually curated from public reporting or official organization materials and then normalized into a consistent schema for the map.

Spreadsheet and JSON exports are generated from that source file with:

```bash
npm run export:data
```

That command writes downloadable files to [`public/data`](./public/data).

For each group, I collect:

- `name`: the canonical base name stored in the source data
- `aliases`: major public alternate names used by vendors or governments when they clearly refer to the same actor
- `firstSeen`: the earliest activity year stated or implied in the cited reporting
- `knownFor`: a short summary of the activity most associated with that group
- `attribution`: a plain-language note describing the public claim about origin, affiliation, or official organizational basis
- `sourceLabel`: a short citation label shown in the UI

In the UI and downloadable CSV/JSON files, the visible `name` field is rendered as a combined label like `Primary, Alias, Alias` when aliases are present.

### How the map location is chosen

The app does not claim precise geolocation of people. Pins represent the best publicly supportable origin level available in open sources:

- If reporting names a city, the pin uses that city
- If reporting only names a country, the pin is placed on the national capital for readability
- If an actor is publicly described as decentralized or lacking a stable origin, the entry can remain in the dataset without map coordinates
- If the entry is a legitimate white-hat organization, the pin uses the organization origin described on its official site or the most relevant official office / headquarters location
- If the entry is a security team inside a larger company, the team name comes from the official product or research page while the pin uses the parent organization’s official headquarters location
- Latitude and longitude are manually assigned map coordinates used for visualization

This means the map is best read as an origin-attribution atlas, not a precise operational geolocation system.

### What is sourced vs. what is editorial

Directly sourced from public reporting or official organization materials:

- Group names and aliases
- Reported country or city of origin
- First-seen timeframe
- Activity summary and attribution note

Editorial or normalized by this project:

- The choice of one canonical base name when multiple sources use different names for the same actor
- The concatenated display/export name format derived from that base name plus aliases
- `type` categories such as `ransomware`, `financial-fraud`, `crypto-crime`, `hacktivist`, `white-hat`, `carding`, `bec-fraud`, and `access-brokerage`
- `scope` labels such as `Global` or `Regional`
- The exact display coordinate used on the map
- The shortened summary text used in cards and detail panels

### Important limitation

Some malicious groups have conflicting or incomplete public attribution. In those cases, the dataset uses the strongest public source I could find, and a small number of entries rely on converging public reporting rather than a single indictment or sanctions notice. White-hat entries are included as official organizations, not attributed threat actors. This repository should be treated as a research-driven visualization layer over public reporting, not as a canonical intelligence database.

Where multiple names clearly refer to the same actor, the atlas keeps one canonical base name in the source data and concatenates the rest into the displayed/exported name, for example `Primary, Alias, Alias`. For defensive organizations, the canonical base name is usually the clearest current official organization or team name rather than a stack of near-duplicate brand variants.

For decentralized collectives such as `Anonymous`, `LulzSec`, and `AntiSec`, the atlas keeps the entry in the searchable dataset and exports but leaves map coordinates blank instead of inventing a symbolic or misleading origin pin.

## Updating the data

When adding or editing a group entry, the workflow is:

1. Find a primary public source such as a government case, sanctions notice, vendor threat profile, or official organization page.
2. Extract the origin claim, first-seen timing, alternate names, and activity summary.
3. Decide whether the attribution is city-level or only country-level.
4. Add the normalized record to `src/data/groups.js`.
5. Run `npm run export:data` to refresh the downloadable CSV and JSON files.
6. Keep the wording conservative if attribution is disputed, incomplete, or simplified from a multi-country ecosystem into a single map pin.

# Cber Actor Atlas

React + Vite + Leaflet map for exploring the publicly reported origins of cyber actors, including malicious groups and defensive white-hat organizations.

## What this project is

This is a curated, static atlas of cyber actors based on public attribution reporting and official organization information.

It is not:

- A live threat-intelligence feed
- A definitive list of every cyber actor
- A claim of legal guilt beyond what public reporting states
- A source of real-time incident statistics

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## What changed

The app now uses a bundled static dataset instead of live venue lookups. The map centers on the world, and the sidebar tracks whichever mapped groups are currently inside the viewport.

The current dataset blends cybercrime groups, hacktivist groups, hybrid actors that mix financial and political motives, and a set of prominent white-hat / defensive organizations.

Each entry includes:

- Group or operation name
- Reported origin point
- Category
- First-seen year
- Aliases and short tradecraft notes
- Attribution note and source label

## Methodology

### How the dataset is built

The dataset is stored locally in [`src/data/groups.js`](./src/data/groups.js). There is no live API call and no automated sync. Each record is manually curated from public reporting or official organization materials and then normalized into a consistent schema for the map.

For each group, I collect:

- `name`: the commonly used public name for the group or operation
- `aliases`: major public aliases used by vendors or governments
- `firstSeen`: the earliest activity year stated or implied in the cited reporting
- `knownFor`: a short summary of the activity most associated with that group
- `attribution`: a plain-language note describing the public claim about origin, affiliation, or official organizational basis
- `sourceLabel`: a short citation label shown in the UI

### How the map location is chosen

The app does not claim precise geolocation of people. Pins represent the best publicly supportable origin level available in open sources:

- If reporting names a city, the pin uses that city
- If reporting only names a country, the pin is placed on the national capital for readability
- If the entry is a legitimate white-hat organization, the pin uses the organization origin described on its official site or the most relevant official office / headquarters location
- Latitude and longitude are manually assigned map coordinates used for visualization

This means the map is best read as an origin-attribution atlas, not a precise operational geolocation system.

### What is sourced vs. what is editorial

Directly sourced from public reporting or official organization materials:

- Group name and aliases
- Reported country or city of origin
- First-seen timeframe
- Activity summary and attribution note

Editorial or normalized by this project:

- `type` categories such as `ransomware`, `hacktivist`, `white-hat`, `carding`, `bec-fraud`, and `access-brokerage`
- `scope` labels such as `Global` or `Regional`
- The exact display coordinate used on the map
- The shortened summary text used in cards and detail panels

### Important limitation

Some malicious groups have conflicting or incomplete public attribution. In those cases, the dataset uses the strongest public source I could find and keeps the wording intentionally cautious. White-hat entries are included as official organizations, not attributed threat actors. This repository should be treated as a research-driven visualization layer over public reporting, not as a canonical intelligence database.

## Updating the data

When adding or editing a group entry, the workflow is:

1. Find a primary public source such as a government case, sanctions notice, vendor threat profile, or official organization page.
2. Extract the origin claim, first-seen timing, aliases, and activity summary.
3. Decide whether the attribution is city-level or only country-level.
4. Add the normalized record to `src/data/groups.js`.
5. Keep the wording conservative if attribution is disputed or incomplete.
